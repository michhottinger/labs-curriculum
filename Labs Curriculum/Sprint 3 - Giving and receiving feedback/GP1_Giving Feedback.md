## Purpose

Giving feedback is part of working with a team. Each of us is constantly giving feedback to one another simply by the way we respond in conversation.

Knowing how to go about giving feedback in a thoughtful, productive, and intentional way is more than a useful life skill, it's a vital tool in any workplace environment.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### Giving proper feedback

* Your Career Specialist gives a presentation on how to give proper feedback.

### *We Do*

#### Searchlight presentation

* Your instructor explains Searchlight and walks you through logistics.

#### Feedback demonstration

* Your instructor writes out feedback for another instructor and discusses how best to structure that feedback with the class (drawing on many of the same questions we encountered in Searchlight).

#### Debrief

* Your Career Specialist leads a discussion on the good and bad of the feedback demonstration.

#### Breakout rooms

* Your instructor sends you into breakout rooms in groups of four. You receive a scenario and characters to inhabit during this feedback session, writing feedback from your character's perspective. Link to your feedback document in Slack.

#### Breakout debrief

* Your Career Specialist reviews several of the documents and offers feedback.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.
