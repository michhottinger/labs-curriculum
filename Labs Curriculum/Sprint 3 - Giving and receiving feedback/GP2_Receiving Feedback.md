## Purpose

"Hey, don't get all defensive! I was just giving you some feedback." Guess what's a whole lot harder than giving feedback: receiving feedback. You worked hard, and watching someone critique your work product hurts. It feels personal -- but it doesn't have to.

You'll be receiving feedback for as long as you find yourself in a workplace (from colleagues, managers, clients, etc.), so learning how to receive it gracefully will serve you throughout your career.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### General feedback overview

* Your Career Specialist gives a short presentation on the fundamental "dos and don'ts" of receiving feedback.

### *We Do*

#### Feedback demonstration 1

* Your instructors conduct a mock feedback session, one giving feedback to the other. Unfortunately, the receiver doesn't take it so well...

#### Debrief

* Your Career Specialist guides a Slack discussion about what the instructor receiving feedback could have done better. Your Career Specialist identifies opportunities for improvement.

#### Breakout rooms

* You enter breakout rooms in groups of 2-3 with hypothetical scenarios. You take a few minutes to practice giving and receiving feedback with one another within the parameters of the scenario.

#### Breakout debrief

* Your Career Specialist leads a discussion on the breakout scenarios, exploring examples and lessons learned.

#### Feedback demonstration 2

* Your instructors conduct a mock feedback session, one giving feedback to the other. Fortunately, this time around the receiver takes the feedback well.

#### Final debrief

* Your Career Specialist leads a discussion on what was better about this second feedback demonstration.

### *You Do*

#### Going over the inquiry

* Your instructor discusses the inquiry questions and what you should focus on in the afternoon.
