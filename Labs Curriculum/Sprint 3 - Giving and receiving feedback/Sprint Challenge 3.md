# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 3

## Objectives

- Student demonstrates they can provide useful feedback to their peers.
- Student can respond productively to critical feedback from their peers and articulate its contribution to their professional development.

## Prompt 1 - Giving Feedback

1. What's an example of an issue you've had in working with another team member? How have you addressed it?
2. What are some benefits and challenges to working with the different personalities and work styles on your team? Please provide an example.

## Prompt 2 - Receiving Feedback

1. How do your teammates tend to describe you?
2. What's the most difficult piece of feedback you've ever received?
3. How have you incorporated that feedback into your personal development?

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development GitHub Profile

In giving and receiving feedback, you learn how others see you. You also discover how you'd like to be seen. Take the feedback you've received and use it to help write about yourself -- incorporate that information into a GitHub Profile README. During your job search, you'll find that many applications ask you to link to your GitHub. Use GitHub as a tool to promote yourself by ensuring you have the following checked off:

## Profile Photo and Name

- [ ]  Profile photo is a clear headshot, bitmoji, or avatar of myself, not the GitHub logo.
- [ ]  Name and username displayed is professional and contains a variation of my name.
- [ ]  Other relevant profiles like `Portfolio` or `Twitter` are linked in my bio.

**Example:**

## Profile README

GitHub now features a profile README section that is customizable. This section will appear above your pinned projects, giving you the opportunity to do some branding and marketing about yourself. If you're new to this feature, check out the first 4 minutes of this *[How to Create a GitHub Profile README](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1z7_GfEPiE).* There are also [templates](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) and [ideas](https://twitter.com/sudo_overflow/status/1281146411736694784?s=21) to get you started on a [personal README](https://dev.to/satvikchachra/how-to-add-an-awesome-readme-to-your-github-profile-361n).

For the purpose of endorsement, include the following information in your README:

- [ ]  Introductory message that welcomes viewers to your page
- [ ]  2-3 quick bullets or sentences that describe yourself: this can include passions, interests, expertise, and what you currently do
- [ ]  Reference skills and expertise you have
- [ ]  Contact information to let others know how they can send you a message

**Example:**

- Here's a short and sweet example you can find in the open-source templates:
