## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

What key words are there for us to know its “force”? (edited) 
How much of a sample size makes it a hotspot?
Who are the users and how will they use this? Does the data need to be real time? Or historical? (edited) 
How should it be visualized? A map of hotspots of police force?
Time and location?
What ways do you need data visualized?
Is there an example sight we should look to?
Competitor?
Do you want our only source of data to be Reddit and Twitter?

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

As a user I can provide consent to view graphic imagery.
As a user I can view most recent incidents from the homepage.
As a user I can filter by different metrics to refine my search.
As a user I can further refine primary data pulled from API.
As a user I can log in and see my viewing history.

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    User story:
    As a user I can view most recent incidents from the homepage.
    Tasks include: 
    HRF-PBI API--cleaning and sourcing data and getting it hosted and deployed.
    Creating a map of police force--need coords and also needs to link to incidents
    Cashing and optimization--might need to cache this if its slow
    
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
We have just begun this process, so I'm not sure what I would do differently. I like all the planning and coordinated thought we are putting into this application. I think there is also value in moving forward to see if the plans are feasable given the reality of you limits. For example, I know we want a map of locations and incidents in real-time, however, perhaps we can only do a map that auto updates every week. Or perhaps geo-tracking is not available from the Twitter API. We just don't know what limits will come up if we don't start the project and find out. This can change the outcome of many other parts of the project.
