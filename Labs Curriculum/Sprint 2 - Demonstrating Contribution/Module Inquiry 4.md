2. Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?

I was able to connect to the Twitter API and pull out data quickly within our process. This helps us visualize the data and understand what we have to work with early. It was difficult to choose the best way to get this information from twitter because I could use Tweepy or the python-twitter wrapper. I also read a lot of twitter docs to determine how to best create a search rather than a user ID "get". I am still working on the search method so that we can enter any word into the URL to search. This is a skill in making my code optimally flexible for user input.

3. How does this feature help the user?

The user needs to be able to enter in keywords and recieve relevant tweets and information about that keyword. My twitter API can do this.

4. Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature?

I would have tested the feature more on my own local notebook before pushing it into github. When I initially pushed it into Github, I underestimated how much work it would be to remove the passcodes for the twitter API. I also need to go back into my github and re-create the .env file to hide those codes. I created more work for myself by rushing to share my progress.
