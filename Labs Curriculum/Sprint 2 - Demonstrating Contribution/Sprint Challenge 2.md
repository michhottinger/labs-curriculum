# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 2

## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.
- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Individual Contribution

On the job, you will be responsible for shipping features regularly. Engineers are given tickets and are expected to deliver them. Hiring managers want to see that you are capable of delivering a feature.

Here are some examples of hiring manager interview questions:

- "Tell me about a project you've built."
- "What were some technical challenges on that project? How did you overcome them?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. This week, you should have shipped at least one feature. Answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

1. Describe what you built this week. Link any relevant pull requests or paste screenshots of code.
2. How does what you built contribute to the overall product your team is building? What user problems does it help solve?
3. Describe your delivery process for what you built this week from ideation to breakdown to implementation. What challenges occurred during the delivery process that you didn't foresee?

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Teamwork

As a software developer, you will almost always be on a team. As a result, engineering hiring managers want to see how you work on a team. As a junior developer, you will often pair with seniors on features. Here are some examples of interview questions you may get asked concerning teamwork:

- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team. What was hard about it?"
- "What is your greatest weakness as a team player? How have you improved?"

This week we taught you how to pair with other team members. You should have worked with at least one other person to deliver a feature. Reflect on that experience and answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

1. How did you work with another team member to deliver a feature this week? What role did you play?
2. What did you learn this week from working in a team? How are you going to improve your teamwork in the future?

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development Resume Updates

This week you gained more clarity surrounding your individual contributions and what is happening with your project. Use this clarification, along with your understanding of power statements, to update the projects sections of your resume. When adding a project to your resume, you should include power statement bullets describing the project as if it were a job! Without these bullets you're simply sharing the name of a project (and maybe a tech stack) with little to no clarity on what you did on that project.

To ensure you are creating a robust and ready to use job search resume, use this [resume checklist](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/Resume-30f5e6add3324891823192487798cb6d) as a way to organize and add content. If you skipped the resume lesson earlier in the curriculum and are starting from scratch, you'll want to review [this assignment worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAvlgwSPTdXxAbtx3mgfWp6dkNnqtzGGLlRy2yQ7fiA/edit) to establish a resume draft (though the resume checklist will help you establish a draft as well).

### To complete the career portion of this challenge:

1. Updated your resume to include your labs project, with power statements articulating your individual tasks.
2. Upload this resume version to CV compiler for feedback:
