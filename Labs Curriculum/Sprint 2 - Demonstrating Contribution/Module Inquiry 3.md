## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

So far we have communicated a lot about solutions to finding location data from the Twitter API. We are still organizing our plan on how to capture data.

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

I have connected with the Twitter API and pulled data off according to our desired keywords. I have done this independently since this is an opportunity for my teammates to also learn how to get data from the API. We also have not confirmed if this is the best way to source our data, so its very exploratory in this phase. I think it's important to be both a driver and navigator so that you can lead when you feel you are capable, and also listen and learn when you are not the strongest in a particular skillset. Right now on our zooms, we are sharing schemas, showing what the data looks like coming off the API and figuring out how best to structure the data.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?

The difficult part about being the navigator is good communication so that the driver can understand what you are trying to say. 

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

I need to do more pair programming in the future to get more feedback and learn more.
