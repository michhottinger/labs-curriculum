## Purpose

Pair programming involves two programmers working together at one station: the driver writes code while the other, an observer/navigator, reviews the code as it's written. The driver and navigator switch roles frequently.

In addition to reviewing the code as it's written, the navigator also considers the strategic direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvement and anticipating potential future problems. The objective of pair programming is to free the driver to focus their attention solely on completing the task itself, relying on the navigator as a safety net and guide.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### What is pair programming?

* Your instructor walks through the definition, roles, and objectives of pair programming.

### *We Do*

#### Live pair programming

* Two engineering managers demonstrate a pair programming session for the class. One acts as driver and the other as navigator.

#### Pair programming feedback

* Your instructor directs you to breakout rooms and where you compare notes on the pair programming session you observed -- what seemed to work well and where you noticed opportunity for improvement.

#### Reviewing feedback

* Your instructors conduct a live review of student feedback on their pairing session and discuss strengths and weaknesses.

#### Instructor/student pairing session

* Your instructor invites a student volunteer to replace an engineering manager in the role of navigator. The student and instructor demonstrate another pairing session for the class (with the instructor driving). They create a pull request together.

### *You Do*

#### Instructor/student feedback

* Your instructor offers feedback on the pair programming session and directs students to schedule a pairing session with another student.

## After Class

Take a few minutes to review the principles you've learned. What questions do you still have? Remember, your instructor, TL, and Labs Support Hours are here to help. Don't hesitate to reach out.
