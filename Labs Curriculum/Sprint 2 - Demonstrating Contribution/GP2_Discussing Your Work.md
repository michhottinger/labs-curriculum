## Purpose

From a hiring manager perspective, the ability to discuss the reasoning and technical decision-making behind the work is just as important as the work itself.

Taking time to consider and practice responding to likely hiring manager questions is just as vital as the time spent assembling a portfolio.

## Lesson

### *I Do*

#### Talking about what you built

* Your Careers Specialist discusses what hiring managers are looking for when they ask candidates to talk about what they built.

### *We Do*

#### Hiring manager questions

* Your Careers Specialist guides class participation via Slack in assembling a number of questions hiring managers could ask about your individual contribution.

#### Mock interview

* Your Careers Specialist interviews the Engineering Manager about a feature they built:
  * "Tell me about a project you worked on"
  * "What did you specifically build on the project?"
  * "Can you show me what you built?"
* During the interview, the Engineering Manager walks through a pull request and live demo of what they built.

#### Breakout room write-up

* In breakout rooms, in groups of four, you're given a set of interview questions. One student in the group pulls up their work and everyone writes answers to the following questions about that work:
  * "Tell me about a project you worked on?"
  * "What specifically did you build on the project?"
  * "Can you show me what you built?"
* For the last question, students should link screenshots and code snippets.

### *You Do*

#### Student interview

* Your Career Specialist and Engineering Manager conduct a live interview with a student volunteer and provide feedback. You'll then be directed to use what you've learned to level up your careers artifacts.
